# AwesomeMod
## About
AwesomeMod is a Discord bot that specializes in moderation. It provides neat and rich logs as well as the ability for users to request roles. Additionally, it has the ability to add a voice channel that's named the amount of members, as Discord makes it difficult to keep track of how many members are in your server. The best part - features can be requested whenever and will be viewed and approved as soon as possible!

## Installation
Currently there's only one way to install the bot on your server - cloning this repository and running it with node. In the future, I plan to add Docker and NPM as viable ways to deploy the bot. As of now, however, follow these steps for installation:

1. Clone repo:
```
git clone https://github.com/ADawesomeguy/AwesomeMod.git
```
2. Enter repo and install dependencies
```
cd AwesomeMod && npm i
```
3. Run the bot:
```
npm run prod
```

## Notes
### Creating a Discord Application/Bot
To create your own application and bot using the [Discord Developer Portal](https://discord.com/developers), go to the previous link and sign in. Then create a new application, and click bots on the left. Configure it to your liking, and then copy the token.

That's the most important part of your bot *and don't share it with anyone*.
